# Database-Systems
The PHP & HTML files found in this repository are associated with a website titled "Welcome to University!".  Building this website was the final project for a Database Systems course taken in Spring 2015 at Foothill College.  The website showcases interaction between HTML & CSS, PHP, and MySQL.  It allows for a user to enter the information for a new "student" who is to be added to a university database.  Hyperlinks to "All Courses", "All Instructors", and "All Students" query the database with MySQL and display the results using PHP & HTML.
